// My approach to the solution, step by step:

// 1. Created the react app from terminal and deleted
// files that I didn't need for the exercise.

// 2. Figured out the main react components: Navbar y Cards.

// 3. Created all necesary jsx and css files for these components.

// 4. Applied a basic jsx squeleton and css style to test if all the files
// were correctly connected.

// 5. Followed sketch to add styles to Navbar & Cards components.
